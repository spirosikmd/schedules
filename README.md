# Schedule

This app lets you create weekly schedules providing a date, location, start and end time, and those who you work with. It is kind of a shift schedule app. The app also supports uploading a weekly schedule with an excel file. However, currently the app supports a very specific structure of the excel file.

## Getting started

To install the modules both for the server and the client run:

```
yarn install
```

To start the server and the client on development run:

```
yarn dev
```

To build the client run:

```
yarn build
```

And to start the server on production run:

```
yarn start
```

For the app to work properly you need to have mongo [installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and up and running.

## Deploy

The app is deployed to Heroku manually!
